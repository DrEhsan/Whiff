# Whiff
   Whiff is a program written to dump packets sent and received by
   the World of Warcraft client. Packets can be parsed using
   TrinityCore's WowPacketParser. Whiff supports 32-bit and 64-bit
   Windows clients, as well as Live and PTR (WoD only) builds.
   Whiff uses Injection, powered by the  MologieDetours library,
   with a few modifications.

### Usage
 - If you wish to have named opcodes in the console, place your
    Opcodes.h(new opcode system) or Opcodes.cpp(old opcode system) or
    Opcodes.cs(WowPacketParser) in the same directory as your Whiff executable
 - Start Whiff (or Whiff-64 for 64 bit clients) from the same directory as Whiff.dll
 - If you want to stop sniffing type 'quit' into the console or CTRL-C
 - .pkt file containing the dumped packets is located where the
       Whiff executable is

### Supported Client Builds
 - All common pre-WoD builds
 - All WoD builds (PTR and Live)
 - Legion is supporting but it is under developing || 7.0.3[22248, 22267, 22277, 22280, 22289]

### WARNING
 Injection writes into WoW's memory at runtime. So Warden (Blizzard's anticheat)
 could detect it. However there have been no reported cases of someone
 getting banned for sniffing.

### Compilation  
 Project files must be generated with CMake.
 CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) is an extensible, open-source
 system that manages the build process in an operating system
 and in a compiler-independent manner. You can download a GUI
 for your Windows OS and generate project files for example
 your Visual Studio.
 
 Alternatively, compiled binaries can be download from https://github.com/Zedron/Whiff/wiki
